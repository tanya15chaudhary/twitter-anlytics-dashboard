Overview: This project is a comprehensive real-time Twitter analytics dashboard developed using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into various engagement metrics, interaction patterns, and trends, enabling effective data-driven decision-making.

Learning Objectives Data Visualization: One of the primary learning objectives was to develop a deep understanding of data visualization techniques using Power BI. This included learning how to create and customize various types of charts and graphs to effectively communicate data insights.

Data Analysis: This aimed to enhance my ability to analyze social media data, focusing on engagement metrics and interaction patterns. I learned how to interpret data trends, compare different engagement metrics, and draw meaningful conclusions from the analysis.

Tool Utilization: Another key objective was to gain practical experience in using Power BI, a leading data visualization tool. This involved mastering its features, such as filtering, aggregating data, and creating interactive dashboards that facilitate data exploration and decision-making.

ETL Process The project involved working on the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process: image

Extract: Data was extracted from a dataset collected from Kaggle.

Transform: Data was cleaned and transformed to make it suitable for analysis. Load: Transformed data was loaded into Power BI for visualization and analysis.

Key Features Interactive Dashboards: The dashboard includes various interactive elements that allow users to explore the data in-depth.

Engagement Metrics: Visualization of key engagement metrics such as likes, retweets, and impressions. Trend Analysis: Analysis of tweet trends over time, including weekly and daily patterns. User Interaction Analysis: Insights into user interactions, including URL clicks and hashtag clicks. Findings Some interesting findings from the dashboard:

The highest engagement rate was observed on certain days of the week. Certain tweets garnered significantly more likes and retweets compared to others. Specific URLs and hashtags received higher user interactions. Dataset The dataset used for this project was collected from Kaggle, ensuring a rich source of real-time Twitter data for analysis.
